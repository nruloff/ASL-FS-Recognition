[University of Michigan MADS program](https://www.si.umich.edu/programs/master-applied-data-science) Capstone Project for [Google - American Sign Language Fingerspelling Recognition Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/asl-fingerspelling)
<br><br><br>
## How to Run M.A.D.S.-A.S.L.-F.R.
Save your own copy of the [MADS-ASL-FR_Colab_Walkthrough](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/18Y5Ab8Otr-9-9REN1ReHveIuZoiz3LL0?usp=sharing) to your Google Drive and follow through to create your own ASL Transformer model.
<br><br><br>
The main dataset used for this project will be the Google - American Sign Language Fingerspelling Recognition Kaggle Competition dataset, which is publicly available at https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/asl-fingerspelling/data. This dataset is a preprocessed dataset of videos analyzed and transformed by Googleâ€™s MediaPipe Holistic model to track the face, each individual hand, and the pose of the body. It is freely available on the competition homepage for download, but discretion is advised since all of the files make up over 180 GB. <br>
